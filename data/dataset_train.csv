NCT00562393,20547978,"study_source: ClinicalTrials.gov | trial_type: INTERVENTIONAL | title: Effects of Excess Energy Intake on Metabolic Risk | abstract: The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions and is associated with the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). A unifying theme has emerged over the past few years suggesting that lipid oversupply to metabolic organs responsible for glucose regulation leads to insulin resistance. Fitting with this, we and others have shown that increased lipid accumulation within skeletal muscle and/or liver is associated with impaired glucose uptake. However, the underlying mechanisms that mediate changes in muscle lipid metabolism are not yet known. The overall aim of this project is to examine metabolic effects of experimental weight gain in lean and overweight individuals with and without a genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes. We hypothesise that lean subjects will increase fatty acid oxidation and upregulate mitochondrial oxidative capacity in muscle following overfeeding to protect against body weight gain and insulin resistance, but overweight subjects with a genetic predisposition to T2DM will have a defect in this ability. | sponsor: Garvan Institute of Medical Research | start_year: 2007.0 | drug_moa_id:  | drug_name:  | drug_description:  | adverse_event_name:  | adverse_event_description:  | intervention_type: OTHER | group_type: EXPERIMENTAL | intervention_name: Nutritional | intervention_description: Overfeeding high fat diet for 28 days","study_source: PubMed | population: Thirty-six healthy individuals (lean and overweight) | interventions: Overfeeding by +1,250 kcal/day (45% fat) for 28 days | outcomes: Subjects gained 2.7 +/- 1.6 kg (P < 0.001) and increased fat mass by 1.1 +/- 1.6% (P < 0.001).

NCT03292692,31380690,"study_source: ClinicalTrials.gov | trial_type: INTERVENTIONAL | title: Empirically-Based Couple Interventions on the Web: Serving the Underserved | abstract: Although several empirically-supported interventions to prevent and treat relationship distress have been developed, the majority of couples - especially high-risk couples - do not seek these face-to-face interventions. However, our pilot data indicate that large numbers of couples will seek self-administered assistance for their relationship. Additionally, unlike many in-person interventions, couples seeking self-help resources tend to have higher levels of relationship distress. Thus, to improve the reach of couple interventions, this project will translate a leading empirically-supported intervention targeting early signs of relationship distress into a Web-based format. This intervention will consist of individualized feedback and professionally-filmed video clips tailored to a couple's specific needs. By intervening effectively with a large number of couples, the resulting Web-based intervention has the potential to have a population-level impact on relationship distress, divorce, and resulting child difficulties.~In the proposed project, building off our previous pilot studies, effective translation of this in-person intervention into a Web-based format will be ensured by conducting two additional intensive pilot studies. Once final changes have been made to the website and Web-based intervention, 300 couples will be randomly assigned to a wait-list control group or an online intervention. All couples will be assessed for the initial two months; intervention couples will be assessed for one year. This project will: 1) demonstrate that couples randomly assigned to the online intervention will report higher levels of individual, child, and relationship functioning than those in the wait-list control group; 2) document the mechanisms of both active conditions; and 3) show that initial gains in those assigned to the intervention are largely maintained through one-year follow-up. | sponsor: University of Miami | start_year: 2013.0 | drug_moa_id:  | drug_name:  | drug_description:  | adverse_event_name:  | adverse_event_description:  | intervention_type: BEHAVIORAL | group_type: EXPERIMENTAL | intervention_name: OurRelationship | intervention_description: Online intervention with coach support","study_source: PubMed | population: Couples (300 couples, 600 individuals) experiencing relationship distress, randomly assigned to either the OurRelationship program or a waitlist control group. | interventions: OurRelationship program | outcomes: Improved relationship satisfaction during the intervention and maintained gains through 12-month follow-up. | group_type: EXPERIMENTAL | primary_endpoint:  | primary_endpoint_domain:  | primary_endpoint_subdomain:",1

In people with or at risk of type 2 diabetes, blood flow does not increase as much after eating a meal, and this may contribute to elevated blood sugar concentrations observed in these individuals.

Obesity is more than twice as prevalent, however, in the Pima Indians of Arizona. Although there have been a number of advances in our understanding of the genetics of obesity, the environmental influences on the genetic expression of obesity requires further investigation.~In an effort to understand some of the influences on the high prevalence of obesity in the Pima Indians, the present study was designed to investigate eating behaviors and food preferences, most especially the preference for high fat foods, in sib-pairs of Pima Indians who have been previously genotyped in our genomic scan for loci linked to diabetes/obesity. Most specifically, we will utilize several questionnaires and methods of assessing eating behavior and the preference for high fat foods to create a food intake phenotype. In addition, we will study Caucasians so that comparisons can be made between these two groups. We will make these evaluations by assessing eating behavior, food preferences including usual fat intake and preferences for high fat foods, body image perceptions, and energy expenditure. It is hoped that the data gathered from this study will elucidate some of the risk factors for the development of obesity among the Pima Indians. | sponsor: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) | start_year: 1999.0 | drug_moa_id:  | drug_name:  | drug_description:  | adverse_event_name:  | adverse_event_description:  | intervention_type:  | group_type:  | intervention_name:  | intervention_description:","study_source: PubMed | population: Eighty-two volunteers (n=82; 53 males; BMI 29 ± 7; age 38 ± 12 years) with food insecurity were studied.

The primary reason for the delay is that daily corticosteroid use has many side effects including short stature, obesity, and osteoporosis. A recent randomized blinded study of weekend oral corticosteroid use over one year showed equal improvement in strength with fewer side effects, particularly as related to growth and cushingoid changes. The investigators will test the efficacy of oral weekend corticosteroid use in infants and young boys with DMD who are under age 30 months. The investigators have demonstrated that the Bayley-III Scales of Infant development shows that infants and young boys in this age group who are untreated decline in abilities when compared to their peers.

Accordingly, it is not surprising that mind/body interventions are advocated for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. One such candidate disease is ulcerative colitis (UC) because: (1) UC is a life-long, relapsing, disabling inflammatory disorder of the intestine that lacks a non-toxic, efficacious treatment; (2) the therapeutic goal is to improve quality of life by ameliorating disabling symptoms and preventing disease progression by preventing disease flare-up, (3) stress triggers UC flare-up by modifying intestinal function and inflammatory processes, highlighting the potential therapeutic benefit of reducing physiological stress responses.

Even after surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF), unsuccessful pain control can lead to morbid outcomes such as pneumonia and opioid dependence. Multi-modal anesthesia, with the use of thoracic epidurals and para-vertebral injections/catheters, has shown to lessen these occurrences but are subject to a wide array of limitations. A more directed therapy with liposomal bupivacaine has shown to provide sustained analgesia for up to 72 hours in patients who have undergone other types of thoracic surgery, but not SSRF. The hypothesis of the current clinical trial is that, among patients undergoing SSRF, liposomal bupivacaine delivered via video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is an intercostal nerve block that provides comparable analgesia to the pain catheter, as measured by pulmonary function, numeric pain scoring, and postoperative narcotic use. | sponsor: Denver Health and Hospital Authority | start_year: 2017.0 | drug_moa_id: 432.0 | drug_name: Liposomal bupivacaine injection | drug_description: A single injection of liposomal bupivacaine is administered at the time of SSRF, directly to the fracture site via VATS | adverse_event_name: Hospital Readmission | adverse_event_description: Organ System: Social circumstances

NCT01267019,29300973,"study_source: ClinicalTrials.gov | trial_type: INTERVENTIONAL | title: Augmenting Social Cognitive Intervention for Veterans With Schizophrenia | abstract: Veterans with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder experience high levels of disability and poor community outcome, and these poor functional outcomes constitute a major public health concern. The treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders has shifted fundamentally from a focus on symptom reduction to a focus on recovery and improving aspects of functioning. Needed improvements in community outcome for patients with these disorders will not occur simply through better control of clinical symptoms. Instead, it is necessary to find new treatments that address the key determinants of poor functional outcome, including social cognition. Both basic (non-social) cognition and social cognition are considered key determinants of functional outcome for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Basic cognition includes the domains of: learning and memory, vigilance / attention, speed of processing, reasoning and problem solving, and working memory. Social cognition generally refers to mental operations that underlie social interactions, including perceiving, interpreting, managing, and generating responses to socially relevant stimuli, including the intentions and behaviors of others. As part of the investigators' previous Merit grant, they have developed a training program for social cognition and are in the process of validating it. Initial results suggest that the program improves performance on measures of social cognition and functional capacity.~In this study, the investigators will evaluate whether adding an in vivo component (training activities that occur in the community) to the current social cognition intervention facilitates generalization of training effects to community outcome and subjective satisfaction. Outcome measures of social cognition and functional capacity will be examined during the 12 week training program, and durability of benefits will be assessed at a 3-month follow up. Generalization to community functioning and subjective satisfaction will be assessed at the end of training and at the 3-month follow up. The investigators will enroll 105 patients across the 5 years of the study with random assignment to training group (social cognition intervention with in vivo exercises, social cognition intervention without in vivo exercises and control). Subjects will receive assessments at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-point), completion of training (12 weeks), and the 3-month follow up. | sponsor: VA Office of Research and Development | start_year: 2011.0 | drug_moa_id:  | drug_name:  | drug_description:  | adverse_event_name: acute exacerbation of symptoms | adverse_event_description: Organ System: Psychiatric disorders

The crying typically starts in the first few weeks of life and ends by 4-5 months of age. The condition is usually self-limited, with no long-term adverse effects; however, it may be very distressing to parents, hence, any safe and effective treatment would be desirable. Recently, it has been suggested that probiotics may offer some benefit.This is based on the results of one open randomized controlled trial. In this trial, 83 breast-fed infants with colic defined as \>3 hours of crying on \>3 days/week were randomly allocated to receive Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (108 colony-forming units, once daily 30 minutes after feeding) or simethicone (60 mg/day as 15 drops twice a day after feeding) for 28 days. Mothers followed a cow's milk free diet. By day 28 after randomization, mothers of infants in the probiotic group were significantly more likely than mothers of infants in the simethicone group to report a reduction from baseline in average crying time to less than 3 hours per day (95% vs. 7%). In addition, median crying times were significantly shorter in the probiotic group than in the simethicone group. No adverse effects of L. reuteri were reported.~Although the mechanism of action of L. reuteri for treating infantile colic has not been elucidated yet, the findings are very promising. However, there are some methodological limitations to the study, including no allocation concealment, no blinding, and no intention-to-treat analysis; these may result in selection, performance, and/or attrition biases and, eventually, invalidate the results. Another limitation of the study is the lack of a true placebo group. Given these consideration a new study is proposed that is aiming to overcome these limitations. | sponsor: Medical University of Warsaw | start_year: 2009.0 | drug_moa_id:  | drug_name:  | drug_description:  | adverse_event_name:  | adverse_event_description:  | intervention_type:  | group_type:  | intervention_name:  | intervention_description:","study_source: PubMed | population: Individuals with PTSD, n = 103 (72 in active group, 31 in control group) | interventions: MDMA (75–125 mg) | outcomes: Significantly greater reductions in CAPS‐IV total scores from baseline (MMRM estimated mean difference (SE) between groups − 22.0 (5.17), P < 0.001). | group_type: EXPERIMENTAL | primary_endpoint: Reduction in CAPS‐IV total scores | primary_endpoint_domain: Physiological/clinical | primary_endpoint_subdomain: General outcomes",0

Further aim is to identify which technique could be the most suitable for full enteral feeding achievement and acquisition of oral feeding. Improving enteral feeding tolerance and promoting oral feeding could improve clinical outcomes and reduce risks and costs of prolonged hospital stay.~Further aim is to evaluate the response to NCPAP and HHHFNC in the treatment of RDS, focusing on a population of extremely low preterms. | sponsor: University of Turin, Italy | start_year: 2019.0 | drug_moa_id:  | drug_name:  | drug_description:  | adverse_event_name:  | adverse_event_description:  | intervention_type: DEVICE | group_type: ACTIVE_COMPARATOR | intervention_name: HHHFNC | intervention_description: Application to HHHFNC to treat respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants previously demonstrated to be stable on a non-invasive respiratory support (HHHFNC or NCPAP).","study_source: PubMed | population: Preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), gestational age of 25-29 weeks, age less than 7 days, need for non-invasive respiratory support, suitability to start enteral feeding.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as tretinoin and arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotoxins, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, may find certain cancer cells and kill them without harming normal cells. Giving tretinoin and arsenic trioxide together with gemtuzumab ozogamicin may kill more cancer cells. | sponsor: M.D. Anderson Cancer Center | start_year: 2011.0 | drug_moa_id: 244.0 | drug_name: Arsenic Trioxide | drug_description: Given IV | adverse_event_name:  | adverse_event_description:  | intervention_type: DRUG | group_type: EXPERIMENTAL | intervention_name: Arsenic Trioxide | intervention_description: Given IV","study_source: PubMed | population: 50 patients with relapsed small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) enrolled between July 2008 and May 2010 | interventions: Topotecan (2.3 mg/m(2)/d) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) combination treatment | outcomes: 3-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 65% (95% CI, 49.3%-76.9%), median PFS was 6.24 months for sensitive subgroup (n=27) and 2.91 months for resistant subgroup (n=23), overall response rate (ORR) was 16%, 40% had stable disease (SD), 26% had progressive disease (PD), median overall survival (OS) was 7.4 months, time to response (TTR) was 1.3 months, duration of response was 4.7 months. | group_type: EXPERIMENTAL | primary_endpoint:  | primary_endpoint_domain:  | primary_endpoint_subdomain:",0
